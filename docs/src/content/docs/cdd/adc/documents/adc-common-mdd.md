# Module -- Adc Core

# High-Level Description

The Adc Common module provides “stateless” application context independent functions which provide functionality required by both the Adc and Adc2 modules.  In order to operate in any given application, the function design must not write to any fixed static variable location, unless it is in Globally shared memory.  All static variable writes outside of Globally shared memory must be performed via pointer access where the caller provides the pointer reference to allowed writable memory in the application context from with the caller is executing.

The motivation for creating core functions is to reduce duplication and testing of common code design.

# Variable Data Dictionary

For details on module input / output variable, refer to the Data Dictionary for the application.  Input / output variable names are listed here for reference.

| Module Inputs | Module Outputs |
| --- | --- |
| None | None |

## Module Internal Variables

This section identifies the name, range and resolutions for module specific data created by this module.  If there are no range restrictions on the variable, the term “FULL” is placed into the table for legal range.

| Variable Name | Resolution | Legal Range<br />(min) | Legal Range<br />(max) | Software Segment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| None |  |  |  |  |

### User defined typedef definition/declaration

This section documents any user types uniquely used for the module.

| Typedef Name | Element Name | User Defined Type | Legal Range<br />(min) | Legal Range<br />(max) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| None |  |  |  |  |

# Constant Data Dictionary

## Calibration Constants

This section lists the calibrations used by the module.  For details on calibration constants, refer to the Data Dictionary for the application.

## Program(fixed) Constants

### Embedded Constants

All embedded constants whose values are provided in Eng units will be evaluated to the equivalent counts by using the FPM_InitFixedPoint_m() macro within the #define statement.

#### Local

| Constant Name | Resolution | Units | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D_NUMOFADCCALREADS_CNT_U8 | 1 | Counts |  |

#### Global

This section lists the global constants used by the module.  For details on global constants, refer to the Data Dictionary for the application.

| Constant Name |
| --- |
| D_FALSE_CNT_LGC |
| D_TRUE_CNT_LGC |
