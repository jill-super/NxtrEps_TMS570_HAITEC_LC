## Module Internal Variables

This section identifies the name, range and resolutions for module specific data created by this module.  If there are no range restrictions on the variable, the term “FULL” is placed into the table for legal range.

| Variable Name | Resolution | Legal Range<br />(min) | Legal Range<br />(max) | Software Segment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ZeroVehSpd_MtrNm_D_u5p11 | 2^-11 | 0 | 8.8 |  |

| BkPtTwo_HwDeg_D_u12p4 | 2^-4 | 0 | 900 |  |

### User defined typedef definition/declaration

This section documents any user types uniquely used for the module.

| Typedef Name | Element Name | User Defined Type | Legal Range<br />(min) | Legal Range<br />(max) |

# Constant Data Dictionary

## Calibration Constants

This section lists the calibrations used by the module.  For details on calibration constants, refer to the Data Dictionary for the application.

| Constant Name |
| --- |
| k_PosMaxOfstOne_HwDeg_u12p4 |
| k_PosMaxOfstTwo_HwDeg_u12p4 |

| t_MaxAsstTblY_MtrNm_u5p11[5] |

## Program(fixed) Constants

### Embedded Constants

All embedded constants whose values are provided in Eng units will be evaluated to the equivalent counts by using the FPM_InitFixedPoint_m() macro within the #define statement.

#### Local

| Constant Name | Resolution | Units | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D_MAXCONF_ULS_F32 | single precision float | Unitless | 1.0 |
| D_ASTVEHSPDLMTLOLMT_MTRNM_F32 | single precision float | MtrNm | 0.0 |

# Software Module Implementation

## Runtime Environment (RTE) Initial Values

This section lists the initial values of data written by this module but controlled by the RTE. After RTE initialization, the data in this table will contain these values.

| Data | Value |
| --- | --- |
| VehSpd_Kph_f32 | 0.0 |
| HwPos_HwDeg_f32 | 0.0 |
| HwPosAuth_Uls_f32 | 0.0 |
| CWPosition_HwDeg_f32 | 0.0 |
| CCWPosition_HwDeg_f32 | 0.0 |
| AstVehSpdLimit_MtrNm_f32 | 8.8 |

## Initialization Functions

None

## Periodic Functions

### Per: _Per1

#### Design Rationale

None

#### Program Flow Start

#### Store Module Inputs to Local copies

HwPosAuth_Uls_T_f32 = Rte_IRead_VehSpdLmt_Per1_HwPosAuth_Uls_f32()

HwPos_HwDeg_T_f32 = Rte_IRead_VehSpdLmt_Per1_HwPos_HwDeg_f32()

VehSpd_Kph_T_f32 = Rte_IRead_VehSpdLmt_Per1_VehSpd_Kph_f32()

CCWEOTPos_HwDeg_T_f32 = Rte_IRead_VehSpdLmt_Per1_CCWPosition_HwDeg_f32()

CWEOTPos_HwDeg_T_f32 = Rte_IRead_VehSpdLmt_Per1_CWPosition_HwDeg_f32()

#### Processing

#### Store Local copy of outputs into Module Outputs

Rte_IWrite_VehSpdLmt_Per1_AstVehSpdLimit_MtrNm_f32(AstVehSpdLimit_MtrNm_f32)
